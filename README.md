# Euler Ruby

This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler problems in [Ruby][1]

It's **NOT** meant to give away the solutions to problems that you haven't solved. That would remove the purpose of Project Euler and also wouldn't be much fun.

These are just my solutions that should produce the correct answers.

You can find the problems at [ProjectEuler.net][2]
